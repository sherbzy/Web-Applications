In this, our first React project, students were asked to use a React Router to recreate the previous assignment: using an api (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/) to create a set of pokemon card that users can interact with. Then, the project
README asked students to compare the two methods and their experience with each.
Note: The previous project required students to use javascript events, and I had a fairly easy time completing it. Since this project was an almost exact replica of the previous one but using different tools, I decided not to keep the last
project so it does not appear on my github.

Project Title: DOM Manipulation with React

Experiences with DOM Manipulation using JavaScript versus React:
Due to previous experience with JavaScript, I had a much easier time completing the first DOM Manipulation
assignment using JavaScript than the one using React. Additionally, it is worth noting that I was at a family
reunion the week that we primarily spent learning React which made it especially difficult to figure out how to
complete the React assignment. Watching the lecture videos and looking at online resources helped me a lot on the
React assignment, yet I did not need to do much googling to figure out the JavaScript assignment. I can
understand how React could be helpful in a project with a larger scope, but at this time I prefer JavaScript
because it was easier for me to both understand and debug. Also, the use of different files containing both html
and "code" was a foreign concept to me until I did the React assignment. 

Overall, since I am used to using JavaScript, I prefer that to React, but if I had a better understanding of
React, I think I would choose to use that for larger projects.
