To Dos (if you have time and wanna update)
        - Add sorting and filtering algorithms for the "View All Movies" page (alphabetical, release year, movie type, streaming platform, etc)
        - Make it prettier with more colors and better ui
        - Add visual validation for when you add/update a movie ("Successfully updated *movie name*")
        - When you add/update a movie, return from the add/update page to that movie's detail page
