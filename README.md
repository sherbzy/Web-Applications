This repository contains the projects from the Web Applications course at Colorado School of Mines taken in Spring 2023. Note: I did not keep the project descriptions from this class.

Course Description:
In Web Applications students will learn how to build effective web-based applications. At the completion of this course, students should know HTTP, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript, Ajax, and RESTful architectures. Additionally students should have considered a variety of issues related to web application architecture, including but not limited to security, performance, web frameworks and cloud-based deployment environments.

Course Goals:
The goal of this course is to provide senior-level students with the skills, experience and perspective necessary to build Web applications using effective, modern tools. In addition, the student is challenged to think about Web application architecture, which has been rapidly changing since the turn of the century. Topics include:
 - Web basics: HTML and CSS
 - JavaScript and JSON
 - Web server: Node.js
 - Web framework: Express.js
 - Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)
 - UI: React library
 - Web architectures: REST, Model-View-Controller, Single Page Application (SPA)
